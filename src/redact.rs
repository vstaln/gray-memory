//! Redaction for anything that can reach a log, a span, or a durable receipt.
//!
//! Two classes of content are stripped before text is allowed to leave the
//! process — either onto a provider's wire or into a journal:
//!
//! 1. **Absolute paths.** `/Users/hunter/src/app`, `/home/x/...`, `C:\Users\…`
//!    and `~/…` carry the operator's username, home directory, and machine
//!    layout. A journal travels further than the machine that wrote it.
//! 2. **Repo-relative paths.** `crates/tui/src/main.rs`, `./deploy.sh`,
//!    `../../secret/notes.md` — and their escaped spellings, `crates\/tui\/…`
//!    and `crates\\tui\\…`. An absolute path discloses the machine; a relative
//!    one discloses the private tree's shape, which is exactly as much as the
//!    reader of a routing summary at another provider needs to reconstruct it.
//!    The rule is deliberately conservative — see `looks_relative` — because
//!    the failure it must not trade for is mangling ordinary prose or a
//!    `provider/model` label.
//! 3. **Secret-shaped tokens.** Provider keys, bearer tokens, and
//!    `SOMETHING_KEY=value` assignments. These have no business in a routing
//!    summary and must never be persisted next to one.
//!
//! Redaction is *recorded*, not silent: [`Redaction::kinds`] names what was
//! removed so a receipt can disclose the fact without disclosing the content.

/// Whether a token is a repo-relative filesystem path, judged conservatively.

/// Two signals, and nothing else, because the cost of a false positive here is
/// paid in the operator's own summary: a redacted word plus a `relative_path`
/// kind on a receipt that removed prose.
///
/// 1. **Explicit relative syntax** — `./x`, `../x`, and their backslash forms.
///    Nothing but a path is spelled that way.
/// 2. **A file extension on the last segment** of a multi-segment token: stem
///    plus 1–8 ASCII *alphabetic* characters. The alphabetic requirement is
///    what keeps `zai/glm-5.2` a model label rather than a file, and the
///    multi-segment requirement is what keeps every bare `provider/model` pair
///    — `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, `anthropic/claude-opus-5` — intact.
///
/// The deliberate gap is an extension-less directory (`crates/tui/src`), which
/// stays. Catching it would need a rule that cannot tell a directory from
/// `read/write/execute`, and shredding prose to hide a directory name is the
/// worse trade.
